# -Data-Science-Bank-Churn-Modeling

A bank operating over three countries in Europe has encountered a problem where a lot of customers have been leaving the bank lately. The bank took a random sample of 10,000 customers to represent the population of its customers and kept tracking of who is leaving the bank over six months and gave you the attached data to perform data mining and deliver some insights that can help the bank solve the problem.
The data given to you for each customer is his customer id, surname, credit score, country, gender, age, tenure (amount of years with the bank), balance, number of products with the bank (credit card, debit card, loan, etc.), whether he has credit card or not, activity status, estimated salary and whether he left the bank or not.
